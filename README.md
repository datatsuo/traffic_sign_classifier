## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

### Overview
The goal of this project is to build a deep neural network model which
classifies German traffic signs. We use [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
to train and test the performance of our model.  

### Contents
The following is the list of key components for this projects:

- `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`: This iPython notebook contains the codes for
this project.

- `report.html`: This is the html version of `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`. 

- `traffic_signs_web` folder: This folder contain 5 German traffic sign images
downloaded from a website. These images are used for analyzing the performance of
our classification model.

- `writeup.md`: This markdown gives a summary of our analysis in `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`.

- `writeup_images` folder: This folder contains the images used in `writeup.md`
